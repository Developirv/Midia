WDI-CC-6 Project #2: Node/Express/MongoDB Full-stack CRUD Application

(Formerly ComTent/ConTent.)


MiDIA- a roof for the creative.


MiDIA is an application that allows writers, content creators, and thinkers to share and recommend the creative endeavors they produce and love.

Once the user has arrived at the application, they will be asked to authenticate their identity to allow for access.

Once sucessfully signed in, a creator can recommend or add content they feel the world should see, creating a "Midia Tent" for that project by either 'Adding a Creator or 'Adding New Midia'.


A user can add content they want others to discover and search for content that other creators recommend.


If you enjoy a creator's Midia tent, you can browse to see what recommendations that creator has outside of their own Midia.



The more content that is added, the higher chances you end up in a wormhole for things you may have never searched for, or things you can now recommend to a friend.


The end goal is an application that provides a one-stop shop for a content creator's multimedia portfolio. 

Type a creator's name and see their work available for your query search by Creator Name, Title, Media Type, Upload Date, and Description.

Technologies used:

MongoDB Mongoose Express Node JS EJS Heroku



Getting Started:

Heroku: https://midia.herokuapp.com

Trello board: https://trello.com/b/IxMV9u8X/midia

Unsolved problems (if any):

Future (Ice Box) Features

Necessary Deliverables:

*A working full-stack application, built by you, hosted on Heroku.

*A Trello board with: User Stories, each moving from left to right in the following three lists in your board: Ice Box Current/MVP Completed.

User Stories must follow the following template: As a , I want , because . The reason is optional if it's blatantly obvious.

Prioritize your user stories within the Ice Box with your "wish list" stories at the bottom.

*Wireframes of your UI.

*An ERD showing the attributes of each model (or schema in the case of embedding) and the associations between them. Here's a YouTube video to show you how.

Technical Requirements:

Your app must:

Have at least 2 data entities in addition to the "user" Model.

One model that represents the main functional idea for your app and another with a 1:M or M:M relationship with that main model (embedded or referenced).


Use OAuth authentication.

Implement basic authorization by restricting access to certain features, such as editing and deleting a resource, to an authenticated user, or the user that created that resource.


Have complete CRUD data operations.

Be styled with well-organized and DRY CSS.

Be deployed online (Heroku).

Optionally, your app may: Consume a third-party API. Expose its own data resources as JSON via an API.
